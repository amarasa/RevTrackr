A plugin that allows you to publish revisions to the website into WordPress for easy tracking.

== Description ==

This plugin allowed you to publish revisions to your website in a markdown file and then is parsed into WordPress for your clients and your team to keep track of what updates are being performed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get updates to display on the main WordPress Dashboard? =

The first first update at the top of the .md file, the content inside of the two horizontal rules is what will automatically display. You should format your updates so the most current is at the top of the document.
